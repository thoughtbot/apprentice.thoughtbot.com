# apprentice.thoughtbot.com

This repository used to hold the content for `apprentice.thoughtbot.com`. That
content is now managed in the handbook and published into the playbook on the
main thoughtbot website. This repository publishes to Netflify which uses the
`netlify.toml` configuration to redirect to the new location.
