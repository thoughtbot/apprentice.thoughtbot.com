            <p>Phil has been designing since the days when table based layouts were the norm, when Photoshop first hit the market, and FrontPage was an acceptable go-to WYSIWYG editor. With an approach to UI design that entails a user-centered design philosophy at it’s core, he strives to combine theory with practice by creating a trail of beautifully precise pixels wherever he goes. A sharply dressed swagger of a fellow, Phil graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in 2009 with a B.S. in Graphic Design.
